## API Reference

### EmissionsCalculator Class

```python
from emissions_calculator import EmissionsCalculator

calc = EmissionsCalculator()

# Calculate Scope 1 emissions
scope1 = calc.calculate_scope1_emissions(
    fuel_type="Gasoline",
    fuel_quantity=100.0,
    vehicle_type="Car - Gasoline",
    vehicle_km=800.0
)

# Calculate Scope 2 emissions
scope2 = calc.calculate_scope2_emissions(
    electricity_kwh=300.0,
    country="United States"
)
